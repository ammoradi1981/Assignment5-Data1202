## Project Title: Analyzing YouTube Data: Grading and Insights

## Short description
This repository comprises scripts and notebooks for analyzing a YouTube dataset. Initially, we generate two new columns utilizing both np.select function and Python functions (e.g., def, if else conditions). Subsequently, the dataset is explored, involving cleaning, visualization through scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, and histograms. Basic statistics are also computed for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
