## Project Title: Analyzing YouTube Data: Grading and Insights

## Short description
This repository comprises scripts and notebooks for analyzing a YouTube dataset. Initially, we generate two new columns utilizing both np.select function and Python functions (e.g., def, if else conditions). Subsequently, the dataset is explored, involving cleaning, visualization through scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, and histograms. Basic statistics are also computed for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Google Colab: Users will need access to Google Colab, a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, to run the project notebooks.
Python: Since Google Colab supports Python, users should have a basic understanding of Python programming language.
With these prerequisites, users can easily access and run the project in a Google Colab environment.

## Installing
Since the project only requires Google Colab and Python, you might not need an "Installing" section. However, before running the project notebooks, ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies. You can do this by executing the following commands in a code cell within Google Colab:
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
!pip install scipy

## Running the Tests
There were no specific tests designed for this project. However, we conducted tests to clean, and visualize data. 

## Breakdown of Tests
Data Validation Tests: These tests ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset by checking for missing values, and irrelevant columns.
Visualization Validation: Tests to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of data visualizations in conveying insights from the dataset. This includes assessing whether the visualizations accurately represent the underlying data and effectively communicate insights to the audience.

## Deployment
The project can indeed be deployed on Colab, which provides a convenient cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. Users can access and run the project notebooks directly on Colab without the need for any local installation.
